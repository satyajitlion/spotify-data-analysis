# Spotify (Track) Dataset Analysis 
This project explores the factors that contribute to a song's popularity on Spotify using a dataset of audio features and metadata. By comparing popular and less-popular tracks, we aim to identify the characteristics most associated with success on the platform.

## Problem Statement
### What makes a song popular on Spotify?
#### In this project, I aim to investigate which audio features (like danceability, energy, or tempo) are most correlated with high popularity scores and how these traits have evolved over time.
